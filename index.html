            <b> Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar </b>(14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956) was
            an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader
            who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the
            Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in
            the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit
            Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism. Ambedkar graduated from
            Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, and studied economics at
            Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving
            doctorates in 1927 and 1923 respectively and was among a handful of
            Indian students to have done so at either institution in the
            1920s.[13] He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his
            early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later
            life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in
            campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing
            journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits,
            and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of
            India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass
            conversions of Dalits.[14] In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's
            highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The
            salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours
            him. He is also referred to by the honorific Babasaheb.
